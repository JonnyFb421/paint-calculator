## Synopsis

The **Paint Calculator** is a hypothetical project that calculates how many gallons of paint would be required to paint a number of rooms.

## Requirements

* Python 3 (not 2)
* Pip

## What we're looking for

* Install Python / Pip
* Run application
* Write Selenium tests against application. They do not have to be in Python, and should be in whatever language you are most comfortable with.
* You are allowed to change any of the source code as you see fit to make things easier for yourself. You are encouraged to fix any bugs you discover.
* Explain any problems you had while writing the tests, and what you did to make it easier. Pointing to localhost for the application is OK.
* Would any of the tests written be suited for a lower level execution, or should they all be in Selenium? If so, where would they be better suited?

## Instructions

Because each applicant's code should be secret from one another, we should not submit it to the same repo.

1. Clone the repo (do not fork)
1. Create a new repo on Github and use what is cloned as the initial commit
1. Create a new branch off of master to put your changes on
1. Run the application locally
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* `python3 app/run.py`
5. Perform testing and debugging activities

## Submitting 

To make it easier on everybody, it's best if we use a PR to diff what work was completed.

1. Create a PR to your new repo
1. Make sure you include your test plan and any automated tests
1. Include any other text in a file - which tests would be suited for a lower level execution, or any problems encountered...etc
1. Send the link to the PR
