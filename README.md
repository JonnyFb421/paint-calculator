## Synopsis

The **Paint Calculator** is a hypothetical project that calculates how many gallons of paint would be required to paint a number of rooms.

## Requirements

* Python 3 (not 2)
* Pip

## Running

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 app/run.py`

## What we're looking for

* Install Python / Pip
* Run application
* Write Selenium tests against application. They do not have to be in Python, and should be in whatever language you are most comfortable with.
* You are allowed to change any of the source code as you see fit to make things easier for yourself. You are encouraged to fix any bugs you discover.
* Explain any problems you had while writing the tests, and what you did to make it easier. Pointing to localhost for the application is OK.
* Would any of the tests written be suited for a lower level execution, or should they all be in Selenium? If so, where would they be better suited?
